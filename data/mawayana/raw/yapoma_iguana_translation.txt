Iguana goes to the sand. She digs her child in the sand. A container for her child. She digs and digs. Iguana is stupid. The Jaguar came to her again: "What are you doing?". "Oh I am digging a container for my child. I am going to give birth", Iguana said. She digs and digs. As she was diggin the Jaguar was moving closer. "Why are you coming close to me?", Iguana said. "I'm going to cathc you as my meat".
